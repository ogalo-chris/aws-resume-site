# ðŸš€ Static Website Hosting on AWS (S3 + CloudFront + Route 53 + SSL)

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website using AWS services â€” ideal for beginners looking to get hands-on experience with cloud hosting.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Amazon S3** â€“ stores static HTML/CSS/JS files
- **Amazon CloudFront** â€“ global CDN for fast delivery
- **Route 53** â€“ DNS & domain management
- **AWS Certificate Manager** â€“ SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** â€“ static frontend website

---
## âœ… Setup Guide

### 1. Create and Upload Static Files to S3
- Create a public S3 bucket named `yourdomain.com`
- Enable static website hosting
- Upload files using AWS Console or:
  ```bash
  aws s3 sync . s3://yourdomain.com --acl public-read

### 2. Make the Bucket Public
â€¢	Add this Bucket Policy:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yourdomain.com/*"
  }]
}

### 4. Set Up AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
Get an SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.
- Go to AWS Console > Certificate Manager > Request a certificate
- Choose Public Certificate
- Enter your domain (e.g., yourdomain.com and www.yourdomain.com)
- Choose DNS validation
- Add CNAME record in Route 53 when prompted
- Once validated, the certificate will show as "Issued".

### 5. Set Up CloudFront (for CDN & HTTPS)
CloudFront caches and distributes your site globally, and allows HTTPS.
- Go to CloudFront > Create distribution
- Origin domain: your S3 bucket (choose the bucket endpoint, not the static site URL)
- Viewer protocol policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Custom domain: yourdomain.com
- SSL certificate: choose the one from ACM
- Default root object: index.html
âœ… After deployment (takes ~10 min), you will get a CloudFront domain like d1234.cloudfront.net

### 6. Register or Use Your Domain in Route 53
Route 53 manages domain records.
- If you have a domain (e.g., from GoDaddy), migrate DNS to Route 53.
Create a hosted zone in Route 53 with your domain name.
Replace NS records in GoDaddy with the ones from Route 53.
- Add an A Record (alias) in Route 53 pointing to your CloudFront distribution.

### 7. Test Your Website
Visit your domain https://yourdomain.com
Should load your static site with HTTPS

You can also try to modify the project and incorporate CI/CD Using Github Actions.
